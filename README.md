# AtmosphericX - NOAA Weather Wire & NWS API Parser 


This repository contains the parsing of both NOAA Weather Wire Service and National Weather Service. It is designed to handle real time weather alerts and messages from the National Weather Service using XMPP. If you do not know basic programming, this parser is not for you. It is intended for developers who want to integrate alerts from NOAA Weather Wire easily into their applications or services without hassle. If you wish to use NWWS without programming, feel free to use our project where most of this code was used - AtmosphericX.
